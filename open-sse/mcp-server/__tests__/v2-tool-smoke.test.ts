/**
 * SMOKE: every registered v2 tool must survive a real call.
 *
 * Why this file exists: the v2 sidecar shipped 49 passing tests while ALL 8
 * tools were broken at runtime. Declaring `outputSchema` without emitting
 * `structuredContent` makes the SDK reject every call with:
 *
 *   -32602 Output validation error: Tool <name> has an output schema but no
 *   structured content was provided
 *
 * Every pre-existing v2 test asserted on a HELPER (extractMeta, withCacheHints,
 * buildInputRequiredResult, routeByHeaders, handleListTools). Not one invoked a
 * registered tool, so the suite was green against a server no client could use.
 * A test that asserts the spec's vocabulary is not a test that asserts the wire.
 *
 * These call through a real MCP client over InMemoryTransport and assert only on
 * observable outcomes: the call resolves, and it is not an SDK-level error.
 * Network is mocked; the tool-call path is not.
